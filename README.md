# Secret-Calculator-Vault

An application that hides your information from others behind a second lock from those who know your iPhone password.

You can add photos, contacts, notes, passwords, and browse the internet with no saved history.

I am still working on the photos portion of my application.

Future Features:
1. Different types of ways to lock the application
  -Dot Connection lock
  -4 digit lock
  -Any length lock
2. Capability to store more types of your information such as files
3. Add a "Settings" tab
  -Ability to change password
  -Ability to change type of lock
4. Photos tab will allow to add more than one photo.
5. Performance and memory management

I would absolutely love feedback.
